### Hey there! <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd5da192-1a5b-4c29-9e70-a6e3cca4eae3" alt="wave" width="25" height="25" />

I'm [**Mohammed**](https://mgahelrasoul.com/), a frontend engineer based in Maryland.

I build and design user experiences.

My main tech stack is react, typescript, tailwind, and motion. My favorite tools are vscode, figma, and clipstudio.

I've built 25+ public repos, not including those on codecommit and gitlab.

My favorite projects aren't all public, but my [Portfolio](https://mgahelrasoul.com/)'s pretty cool.
